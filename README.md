This project shows the implementation of feed-forward neural network from scratch.

Part A
XOR classification problem has been solved using the architecture with one hidden layer composerd of 2 units.

Part B
This program also features the network with one hidden layer composed of 3 hyperbolic tangent hidden units
where data set has been generated within the program
